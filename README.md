# War-of-Gillysburg
Contains code created by Wyatt Witemeyer for the game he is creating: War of Gillysburg.
Details and documents describing how the game works is stored in a Google Drive folder.
To run the code, make sure all the files are in the same location (and that the package name lines up as desired for each class).
Then, run the Demo java file to see a demonstration of how the code works in general and to be able to test different features.
Currently in progress are the additions of each class to work with BattleSimulator.
